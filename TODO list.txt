Add "bonuses"...
...attribute modifiers and potion effects are directed toward bonuses instead of sets
...bonuses are defined with conditions that need to be met to activate them (which can include a certain number of items from an equipment set)

Discovery system for bonuses...
...0 = Discoverable (invisible to clients until they activate it for the first time)
...1 = Globally Known (always visible to clients) (keep track of discovery even if this is enabled, in case the setting is changed later)

Alternate requirements...
...stat requirements
...Morph / Metamorph transformation

Attack effects (like those in DS) that use set filtering

Improve efficiency via...
...inventory change detection (from library)
...caching

Make some default sets
