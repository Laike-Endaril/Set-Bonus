Look into simplifying configs...
...look into on-the-fly additions/removals of config categories
...look into enum array config type

Look into damage-type-specific resistances as bonuses

Look into possible race condition issue, where eg...
...bonus A activates when armor is low enough, and increases attack power
...bonus B activates when attack power is high enough, and increases armor
1. bonus A activates, increasing attack power
2. this causes bonus B to activate, increasing armor
3. this causes bonus A to deactivate, decreasing attack power
4. this causes bonus B to deactivate, decreasing armor
5. repeats from 1

Add discovery system for sets (in addition to the one for bonuses)?

Look into enchantments as bonuses...
...could this be done with ItemStacks that exist only in memory?
...if not, could it be done with inaccessible equipment slots containing dummy items?

"Discover" command
"Undiscover" command
"WipeDiscoveries" command

"Reactive" system for equipment sets which gives a visual indicator for set items and for linking the items of a set...
0 means reactive within the player's inventory (an opened chest is not part of the player's inventory)
1 means reactive only when actively contributing to a set
1 means reactive within all opened inventories
2 means non-reactive

Alternate requirements...
...Morph / Metamorph transformation

Attack effects (like those in DS) that use set filtering

Improve efficiency via...
...inventory change detection (from library)?
...caching

Make some default bonuses
