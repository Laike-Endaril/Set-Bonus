Merge Set and SetData if possible
Merge Bonus and BonusData if possible

Implement discovery system; only send discovered bonuses to clients...
...0 = Discoverable - invisible to clients until they activate it for the first time
...1 = Identifiable - always visible to clients, but obfuscated until they activate it for the first time
...2 = Globally Known - always visible to clients (keep track of discovery even if this is enabled, in case the setting is changed later)

SetBonus GUI...
...add SetBonus GUI key
...pressing key while an item tooltip is showing opens the SetBonus GUI in filtered mode
...otherwise, the key opens the SetBonus GUI in unfiltered mode
...create SetBonus GUI

"Discover" command
"Undiscover" command
"WipeDiscoveries" command

"Reactive" system for equipment sets which gives a visual indicator for set items and for linking the items of a set...
0 means reactive within the player's inventory (an opened chest is not part of the player's inventory)
1 means reactive only when actively contributing to a set
1 means reactive within all opened inventories
2 means non-reactive

Alternate requirements...
...stat requirements
...Morph / Metamorph transformation

Attack effects (like those in DS) that use set filtering

Improve efficiency via...
...inventory change detection (from library)
...caching

Make some default sets
