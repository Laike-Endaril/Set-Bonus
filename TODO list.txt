Fix discoveries not persisting properly...
...SP: bugged
...LAN: ?
...Dedicated: ?

Add discovery system for sets (in addition to the one for bonuses)?

Look into enchantments as bonuses

"Discover" command
"Undiscover" command
"WipeDiscoveries" command

"Reactive" system for equipment sets which gives a visual indicator for set items and for linking the items of a set...
0 means reactive within the player's inventory (an opened chest is not part of the player's inventory)
1 means reactive only when actively contributing to a set
1 means reactive within all opened inventories
2 means non-reactive

Alternate requirements...
...Morph / Metamorph transformation

Attack effects (like those in DS) that use set filtering

Improve efficiency via...
...inventory change detection (from library)?
...caching

Make some default bonuses

Look into issue when downgrading bonuses...
...if a bonus to health downgrades from +20 to +10 due to the number of set items decreasing, does it...
...adjust current HP correctly?
...keep the high value for current HP?
...adjust current HP down to the max without *any* bonus?

Look into possible race condition issue, where eg...
...bonus A activates when armor is low enough, and increases attack power
...bonus B activates when attack power is high enough, and increases armor
1. bonus A activates, increasing attack power
2. this causes bonus B to activate, increasing armor
3. this causes bonus A to deactivate, decreasing attack power
4. this causes bonus B to deactivate, decreasing armor
5. repeats from 1
