Add "bonuses"...
...attribute modifiers and potion effects are directed toward bonuses instead of sets
...bonuses are defined with conditions that need to be met to activate them (which can include a certain number of items from an equipment set)

Discovery system for bonus tooltips (can apply to any part of tooltip, if applicable)...
...0 = Discoverable - invisible to clients until they activate it for the first time
...1 = Identifiable - always visible to clients, but obfuscated until they activate it for the first time
...2 = Globally Known - always visible to clients (keep track of discovery even if this is enabled, in case the setting is changed later)

"Reactive" system for equipment sets which gives a visual indicator linking the items of a set...
0 means reactive within the player's inventory (an opened chest is not part of the player's inventory)
1 means reactive within all opened inventories
2 means non-reactive

Alternate requirements...
...stat requirements
...Morph / Metamorph transformation

Attack effects (like those in DS) that use set filtering

Improve efficiency via...
...inventory change detection (from library)
...caching

Make some default sets
