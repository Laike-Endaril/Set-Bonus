In config...
...add example to bonuses
...change tooltip for attribute modifier bonuses
...change tooltip for potion effect bonuses
...add new tooltips to lang file

Discovery system for bonus tooltips (can apply to any part of tooltip, if applicable)...
...0 = Discoverable - invisible to clients until they activate it for the first time
...1 = Identifiable - always visible to clients, but obfuscated until they activate it for the first time
...2 = Globally Known - always visible to clients (keep track of discovery even if this is enabled, in case the setting is changed later)

"Discover" command
"Undiscover" command

"Reactive" system for equipment sets which gives a visual indicator for set items and for linking the items of a set...
0 means reactive within the player's inventory (an opened chest is not part of the player's inventory)
1 means reactive only when actively contributing to a set
1 means reactive within all opened inventories
2 means non-reactive

Alternate requirements...
...stat requirements
...Morph / Metamorph transformation

Attack effects (like those in DS) that use set filtering

Improve efficiency via...
